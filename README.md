The first homework:

Automate the following scenario in the src/test/kotlin/FirstTest.kt

1. Open an IDE (you can use any type of an IDE created by JetBrains)
2. You can use the project used in the training course as a test project in your test (https://github.com/JetBrains/ij-perf-report-aggregator) or any other publicly available project
3. Open Settings...
4. Choose "Version Control" and then "Changelists"
5. Select the checkbox that is called "Create changelists automatically"
6. Check that it is selected. You can use Assertions.assertTrue() from JUnit5
7. Click on the OK button

Please, write a test and when you are done with this task, send only one file with your test to @maxim.kolmakov.
Please, do not commit/push to the repository yet.
